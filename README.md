### 


The data for the analysis has been sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction)**. 



#### The analysis is focussed on answering questions stated below: 

  * Does killing more people increases the chance of winning the game?
  * Can we predict the finishing position of a player in the game?
  * Can we predict the winner of the game?
  * How different/similar are the strategies required to win the game when playing solo, duo, or in a group?
  * How do we catch the cheaters in the game?
  * How does the weapon acquisition strategy differ for players in different clusters?



#### Final results and analysis [Presentation](https://github.com/harshbg/PUBG/blob/master/Big%20Data%20Project%20-%20Group%207-%20Final.pdf). All the codes used in the analysis can be accesed [here](https://github.com/harshbg/PUBG/tree/master/Code).
